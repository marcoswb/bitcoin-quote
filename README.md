# bitcoin-quote

Script that will inform the main bitcoin information at the moment.

Based on the API "https://www.mercadobitcoin.net".

The script accepts two parameters on execution:

1st. Waiting time until next request(default 2).

2nd. Number of requests the script will make (default 5).

So the execution will look like this:
`./execute.sh 5 2`
